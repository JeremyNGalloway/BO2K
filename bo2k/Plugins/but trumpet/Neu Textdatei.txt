20/07/99 - Butt Trumpet 2000 - Int_13h  
Description  

This DLL (with source code) is a plugin for Back Orifice 2000. It duplicates the functionality of the original Butt Trumpet plugin for the original Back Orifice, plus adds some more. This plugin has been designed to send an email message to you, the administrator, after BO2K has been successfully installed on a client machine. It allows you to easily keep track of who is remotely administratable.

Installation
________________

BT2K is structly a server side plugin. There is no client component. 
To create a new server with BOred included perform the following steps:
1) Run bo2kcfg.exe
2) Create a bo2k server, following the BO2K directions (either using 
the wizard, or directly with the configuration tool)
3) Once you see the "BO2K Server Configuration" tool, you will need to click
on "Open Server..."
4) Select the server you have, typically "bo2k.exe"
5) Click on "Insert..." under plugins
6) Select "BT2K.dll"
7) You will now see "Butt Trumpet 2000" in the plugins list
8) Configure the server, as listed below.
9) Select "Save Server"
10)Exit
The server is now ready to load on to a computer.



Configuration
____________


Configuration is relatively easy. Under the ServerConfiguration
utility, look at the "Option Variables" tree. Toward the bottom,
you should see a folder for "Butt Trumpet 2000." In this folder,
you can set the following options (be sure to click on the "Set 
Value" button after typing in the new value):


* Destination EMail
This is the address that automated messages are sent to. This
can be the administrator account on your company's LAN. It
could be your ISP email account. It could be a Hotmail account.
If you are doing something "shady" with Back Orifice, you may
want to consider using some anonymous remailers and 
Hotmail-like accounts.

* Mail Server
This is the mail server to use. It can be fairly tricky to find
the proper value here. If you are using your ISP email account,
put the ISP's mail server here (for isntance mail.myprovider.com).
If you are using a web-based email account, you must put in the
address of their MAIL SERVER, and not their WEB SERVER. The
unix-savy can use a tool such as "dig" to perform a DNS query
for the service's MX record. The rest of you can try to find
an similar tool for Windows (Good luck! I have yet to find one.
Although, if you do happen to know of a port of "dig" for
Windows, PLEASE let me know!) or use any of the following values:
hotmail.com -> mail.hotmail.com
yahoo.com -> mx1.yahoo.com
hushmail.com -> www.hushmail.com
rocketmail.com -> mta1.rocketmail.com
altavista.net -> spool.globecomm.net
angelfire.com -> mta1-mail.angelfire.com
juno.com -> a.mx.juno.com
mailcity.com -> mta5-mail.mailcity.com
At the time of this writing, the above mail servers were 
correct. I cannot guarantee that they will be correct at any
later date.

ALSO: Be aware that some mail servers, in an effort to prevent
spamming will only allow you to send to addresses that exist
in their mail system. Unless you really know what you are
doing, be sure that the mail server you use matches up with
the email address you use.

* Repeat Process
Disabled: Only one email message will ever be sent out from
the BO2K'ed machine. (Although you can manually send more
using the "Debug:Resend Message" command).
Enabled: A message will be sent each time the BO2K server
is started. In other words, each time the computer is
rebooted.

* Message
A piece of text to send in the notification message. Most
likely, you will want to use it as a note to youself. It
will help you remember what computer or BO2K server sent
the message. You can also use it as a reminder of what
port and password the server uses. You can type whatever
the hell you want here.

Usage
______


As soon as Back Orifice 2000 is launched on the remote
computer, the email action is performed. 
From the BO2K GUI, you can perform the following
operations:
Debug:Show
Displays the debug log of exactly what is going on with the
plugin.
Debug:Clear
Clears the debug log
Debug:Resend Message
This will cause the remote machine to send an email message
immediately. If you have the remote machine set up to send 
an email message only once, this will cause the machine to
"forget" that it has done so. Hence, it will send again until
successful.

EMail
_______


The email message that gets sent to you contains the 
following pieces of information:
* The logged in user's username
* The computer's name
* The date/time
* A custom message (see "Message" above in the configuration
section)
* The IP address or addresses that are bound to the computer.
A maximum of six will be displayed.
